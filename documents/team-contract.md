## Contract Terms

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

We want to have regular check-ins to make sure we're making progress and listening to everyone's ideas and contributions. We want to be an efficient and comfortable team.



2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

* Respond to communication/messages from teammates
* Make sure to attend regular check-ins and take on a fair share of work so no one person is carrying the team
* Be helpful and non-condescending


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

We're going to have a group Slack for regular communication, as well as biweekly progress meetings.



4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

We're going to have one initial skype or in-person meeting with our client, and then communicate via email.


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

For the most part, everyone is going be treated equally and expected to do the same amount of work,and be equally as responsive and communicative.
One team member may be assigned the role of the primary communicator, to schedule meetings or set reminders, if necessary.
We will also have roles of coders/designers. Coders will be responsible for implementing certain designs
or functionalities of the website while designers will sketch out how each webpage will look.


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

We'll hold ourselves accountable to the goals we set at our regular check-ins by going through the todos assigned to every member, and checking if they achieved those goals or not.
If someone is unable to deliver what was promised, we're going to look into why- maybe we gave them a harder part of the project, in which case we'd help them finish their work.
If a team member is just slacking for no apparent reason, we're going to have to warn them about the terms of our contract, and let them know that the others aren't just going to let them take credit for work they're not doing. If they refuse to listen to multiple warnings, we're going to bring it to the attention of a TA and hopefully sort it out with their help.


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

We all agree to be civil and polite about conflict- we're all learning the same things, so no one's ideas are bad or worthless. Group discussions and votes are always a good idea, and hopefully we'll able to be able to resolve conflicts this way.


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

If anyone is uncomfortable with the contract, or decides they want to add something- they're free to do so as long as the other team members agree to the change. The person that wants to add something should talk to the other members beforehand, and send a message in the Slack with the exact wording of the new clause. Moreover, whenever an issue arises
within the group we will visit the contract first to try and solve that issue.



10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

Use fun emoji reacts in the Slack!



## How to Use This Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
